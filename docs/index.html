    These are examples of messages sent now and then in online chat rooms;
    it's great to see you have the enthusiasm to start such a big project,
    but it's better to start small. 
    <br><br>
    Starting on a project would not be super difficult if you have a solid
    understanding of the basics. However, someone who has never programmed before
    would find this to be extremely challenging.
    <br><br>
    If you were to start on a new programming project, let's say a Super Mario Bros
    clone, you would start to ask questions like these:
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">bluecap3:</span>
        How can I create a Window?
        <br>
        <span class="name">bluecap3:</span>
        How to add stuff to a list?
        <br>
        <span class="name">bluecap3:</span>
        Can someone explain what is the purpose of having a Hashmap?
        <br>
        <span class="name">bluecap3:</span>
        Can someone make a physics engine for my Mario game?
        <br>
        <span class="name">bluecap3:</span>
        How do I detect when something is not something?
    </blockquote>
    If you rely on people to mouthfeed you the answers to your project, you might as well
    give credit to them.
    <br><br>
    Starting with small projects such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Wordle, or Pong can help you
    build your foundational knowledge so you can move up to larger projects.
    Learn a little at a time.
